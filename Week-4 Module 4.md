# Chapter 8: Data Governance
## Data Governance Concepts

Data governance is the set of policies, procedures, and controls that an organization develops to safeguard its information while making it useful for transactional and analytic purposes. As the name implies, data governance is primarily a business function. Governments have a method for creating, interpreting, and enforcing laws. Part of this process ensures that these laws are known to the citizenry. For organizations, data governance is an umbrella term covering the creation, interpretation, and enforcement of data use.

Organizations develop numerous policies to govern their data. These policies promote data quality, specify the use of data attributes, and define access to different data domains. Additional governance policies identify how to secure data, comply with regulations, protect data privacy, and deal with data over time. Just as countries enforce laws, organizations implement procedural and technical controls to comply with data governance standards.

Strong executive support is vital to any data governance effort. An organization invests a significant amount of time and resources to define, develop, implement, and control access to data. For data governance to succeed, all levels of an organization must appreciate the importance of well-governed data. While technology is a critical component to facilitating adherence to policies, an information technology organization can't drive data governance efforts on its own. You need executive support across the organization for data governance efforts to succeed.

## Data Governance Roles

It takes multiple people fulfilling a variety of roles for data governance to thrive. A crucial concept relating to data governance is data stewardship. Stewardship denotes looking after something, like an organization or property. Data stewardship is the act of developing the policies and procedures for looking after an organization's data quality, security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. The most vital role for effective data stewardship is that of the organizational data steward. An organizational data steward, or data steward, is the person responsible for data stewardship.

The data steward is responsible for leading an organization's data governance activities. As the link between the technical and non-technical divisions within an organization, a data steward works with many people, from senior leaders to individual technologists. To establish policies, a data steward works with various data owners.

A data owner is a senior business leader with overall responsibility for a specific data domain. A data domain, or data subject area, contains data about a particular operational division within an organization. Finance, human resources, and physical plant are all examples of operational divisions. Data owners work with the data steward to establish policies and procedures for their data domain.

In large, complex organizations, data owners may choose to delegate day-to-day governance activities to subject area data stewards. A subject area data steward works in the data owner's organization and understands the nuances that apply within that organizational unit. A subject area data steward works on behalf of their data owner to handle daily tasks. For example, processing access requests as people rotate in and out of roles is a responsibility a data owner may delegate to their subject area data steward. The need for subject area data stewards arises from the intricacies of different data domains. To implement data governance policies, data stewards work with data custodians.

A data custodian is a role given to someone who implements technical controls that execute data governance policies. Data custodians are frequently information technology employees who configure applications, dashboards, and databases.
