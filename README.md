# Data Analytics Week-1

## Module 1: Basics of Data 

Analytics is the heart of modern business.
The role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization.

### Several key responsibilities and skills

#### Data Collection and Preparation:

* Sourcing daata from various channels, including database, spreadsheets, and external sources,
* Cleaning and organizing data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

#### Data analysis:

* Make use of statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
* Identify trends, patyterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

#### Data Visualization and Storytelling:

* Creating visual representations of data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
* Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.

#### Decision Support:

* Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
* Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.

#### Collarboration and Communication:

* Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finace, and operations, to understand their needs and provide insights,
* Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders.

#### Continuous Learning and Adaptation:

* Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
* Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

### World of Analytics

Three major pillars that have come together at this moment to allow analytics program to thrive:

* Data
* Storage
* Computing Power

The massive volume of data generated by our businesses on a daily basis, the availability of inexpensive storage to retain that data, and the cloud's promise of virtually infinite computing power come together to create fertile ground for data analytics.

### Carrers in Analytics

Highest-demand occupations:

* Data analydts and scientists
* AI and machine learning (ML) specialists
* Big Data specialists
* Digital marketing and strategy specialists
* Process automation specialists
* Business development professonals
* Digital transformation specialists
* Information security analyst
* Software and applications developers
* Internet of Things (IoT) specialists

### The Analytics Process

Process that analysts move through:

* Data Acquisition
* Cleaning and Manipulation
* Analysis
* Visualization
* Reporting and Communication

### The Analytics Process is Iterative

The analytics process is inherently iterative. It is not linear, one-time thing you do to data. It's more like a loop or cycle where you constantly revisit previous steps and refine your approach based on what you learn.

### Analytics Techniques

Analysts use a variety of tecniques to draw conclusions from data at their disposal.

Major categories of analytics techniques:

* Descriptive Analytics: is a crucial first step in data analysis journey. It provides a foundational understanding of your data before diving into more complex techniques like predictive or prescriptive anallytics. It summarises data to gain insights into patterns, trends, and relationships. It focuses on what happened in the past and identifying trends and patterns within your data.

* Predictive Analytics: aims to forecast future outcomes based on historical data and statistical algorithms. It involves use of techniques such as regression analysis, machine learning, and data mining to identify patterns and trends that can help predict future events or behaviors. It enables organizations to anticipate potential scenarios and make proactive decisions to optimize outcomes.

* Prescritive Analytics: is a powerful tool that can transform data insights into concrete actions for achieving optimal outcomes.

### Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,and Deep Learning

The work of analytics is intellectually and computionally demanding.

* Artificial intelligence (AI): includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior.
* Machine Learning: is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge. ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.
* Deep Learning: is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.
