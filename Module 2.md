# Databases and Data Acquisition
## Exploring Databases

There are many different database options to choose from when an organization needs to store data. While many database products exist, they belong in one of two categories:

* Relational
* Nonrelational

Relational databases excel at storing and processing structured data. The need to interact with unstructured data is one of the reasons behind the rise of nonrelational databases.

### The Relational Model

* In 1969, IBM's Edgar F. Codd developed the relational model for database management.
* The relational model builds on the concept of tabular data.
* In the relational model, an entity contains data for a single subject.
